According to the International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED), education is defined as organized and sustained communication designed to bring about learning. Formal education is defined in ISCED as education that is institutionalized, intentional, and planned through public organizations and recognized private bodies and, in their totality, make up the formal education system of a country. Non-formal education, like formal education is defined in ISCED as education that is institutionalized, intentional and planned by an education provider but is considered an addition, alternative and/or a complement to formal education. It may be short in duration and/or low in intensity and it is typically provided in the form of short courses, workshops or seminars. Informal learning is defined in ISCED as forms of learning that are intentional or deliberate, but not institutionalized. It is thus less organized and less structured than either formal or non-formal education. Informal learning may include learning activities that occur in the family, in the work place, in the local community, and in daily life, on a self-directed, family-directed or socially-directed basis. For the purposes of this indicator, persons will be considered in education if they are in formal or non-formal education, as described above, but excluding informal learning. Persons in employment are defined as all those who, during a short reference period, were engaged in any activity to produce goods or provide services for pay or profit. They comprise - i) employed persons \u201cat work\u201d, i.e. who worked in a job for at least one hour; ii) employed persons \u201cnot at work\u201d due to temporary absence from a job, or to working-time arrangements (such as shift work, flexitime and compensatory leave for overtime). For the purposes of this indicator, persons are considered to be in training if they are in a non-academic learning activity through which they acquire specific skills intended for vocational or technical jobs. Vocational training prepares trainees for jobs that are based on manual or practical activities, and for skilled operative jobs, both blue and white collar related to a specific trade, occupation or vocation. Technical training on the other hand imparts learning that can be applied in intermediate-level jobs, in particular those of technicians and middle managers. The coverage of vocational and technical training includes only programmes that are solely school-based vocational and technical training. Employer-based training is, by definition, excluded from the scope of this indicator.","computation_calculations":"((Youth \u2013 Youth in employment \u2013 Youth not in employment but in education or training) / Youth) * 100","reporting_status":"complete","data_non_statistical":false,"graph_type":"line","graph_title":"Percentage of youth (aged 16-24 years) not in education, employment or training","data_show_map":false,"data_keywords":"Labour Force","source_active_1":true,"source_organisation_1":"Office for National Statistics (ONS)","source_periodicity_1":"Quarterly","source_earliest_available_1":"2002","source_geographical_coverage_1":"United Kingdom","source_url_1":"https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peoplenotinwork/unemployment/datasets/youngpeoplenotineducationemploymentortrainingneettable1","source_url_text_1":"Young people not in education, employment or training (NEET)","source_release_date_1":"22/11/2018","source_next_release_1":"28/02/2019","source_statistical_classification_1":"National Statistic","source_contact_1":"EarlyYears.STATISTICS@education.gov.uk","source_other_info_1":"Source metadata - https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/employmentandemployeetypes/qmis/labourforcesurveylfsqmi","source_active_2":false,"source_active_3":false,"source_active_4":false,"source_active_5":false,"source_active_6":false,"indicator_sort_order":"08-06-01","comments_limitations":">- >- >- The CSEW does not cover the population living in group residences (for example, care homes or student halls of residence) or other institutions This indicator is being used as an approximation of the UN SDG Indicator.
