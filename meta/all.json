ages of 15 and 24 (inclusive). According to the International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED), education is defined as organized and sustained communication designed to bring about learning. Formal education is defined in ISCED as education that is institutionalized, intentional, and planned through public organizations and recognized private bodies and, in their totality, make up the formal education system of a country. Non-formal education, like formal education is defined in ISCED as education that is institutionalized, intentional and planned by an education provider but is considered an addition, alternative and/or a complement to formal education. It may be short in duration and/or low in intensity and it is typically provided in the form of short courses, workshops or seminars. Informal learning is defined in ISCED as forms of learning that are intentional or deliberate, but not institutionalized. It is thus less organized and less structured than either formal or non-formal education. Informal learning may include learning activities that occur in the family, in the work place, in the local community, and in daily life, on a self-directed, family-directed or socially-directed basis. For the purposes of this indicator, persons will be considered in education if they are in formal or non-formal education, as described above, but excluding informal learning. Persons in employment are defined as all those who, during a short reference period, were engaged in any activity to produce goods or provide services for pay or profit. They comprise - i) employed persons \u201cat work\u201d, i.e. who worked in a job for at least one hour; ii) employed persons \u201cnot at work\u201d due to temporary absence from a job, or to working-time arrangements (such as shift work, flexitime and compensatory leave for overtime). For the purposes of this indicator, persons are considered to be in training if they are in a non-academic learning activity through which they acquire specific skills intended for vocational or technical jobs. Vocational training prepares trainees for jobs that are based on manual or practical activities, and for skilled operative jobs, both blue and white collar related to a specific trade, occupation or vocation. Technical training on the other hand imparts learning that can be applied in intermediate-level jobs, in particular those of technicians and middle managers. The coverage of vocational and technical training includes only programmes that are solely school-based vocational and technical training. Employer-based training is, by definition, excluded from the scope of this indicator.","computation_calculations":"((Youth \u2013 Youth in employment \u2013 Youth not in employment but in education or training) / Youth) * 100","reporting_status":"complete","data_non_statistical":false,"graph_type":"line","graph_title":"Percentage of youth (aged 16-24 years) not in education, employment or training","data_show_map":false,"data_keywords":"Labour Force","source_active_1":true,"source_organisation_1":"Office for National Statistics (ONS)","source_periodicity_1":"Quarterly","source_earliest_available_1":"2002","source_geographical_coverage_1":"United Kingdom","source_url_1":"https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peoplenotinwork/unemployment/datasets/youngpeoplenotineducationemploymentortrainingneettable1","source_url_text_1":"Young people not in education, employment or training (NEET)","source_release_date_1":"22/11/2018","source_next_release_1":"28/02/2019","source_statistical_classification_1":"National Statistic","source_contact_1":"EarlyYears.STATISTICS@education.gov.uk","source_other_info_1":"Source metadata - https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/employmentandemployeetypes/qmis/labourforcesurveylfsqmi","source_active_2":false,"source_active_3":false,"source_active_4":false,"source_active_5":false,"source_active_6":false,"indicator_sort_order":"08-06-01","comments_limitations":">- >- >- The CSEW does not cover the population living in group residences (for example, care homes or student halls of residence) or other institutions This indicator is being used as an approximation of the UN SDG Indicator.

The LCF is an annual survey of the expenditure and income of private households; people living in hotels, lodging houses and institutions such as old people\u2019s homes are excluded. It is the only data source to collect detailed data on both income and expenditure, thereby allowing analysis of the two measures. As with all surveys, there are some limitations to be aware of. The LCF is known to not fully capture those at the poorest and richest ends of income distribution and suffers from non-response error . When analysing inequalities, this can impact on the representation of the target population (in this case, the bottom 40%) and the overall appearance of income distribution. In international comparisons, data has been sourced from the World Bank, and data for the UK comes from Eurostat\u2019s  European Union Statistics on Income and Living Conditions (EU-SILC). The EU-SILC collects data on poverty, income, social exclusion and living conditions. In the international analysis, the total population and the target population (bottom 40%) are defined on a household level, before housing costs (BHC). Eurostat sets the reference year at T-1 from the survey year, therefore 2009 reference year will refer to 2010 survey data. In addition, data from the World Bank is from 91 countries. Not all these countries will have annual surveys, therefore the reference years for the annualised growth rates are labelled at circa 2010 to 2015. The annualised growth rate is computed as - (mean in year 2/mean in year 1)^(1/(reference year 2 \u2013 reference year 1)). Data follows the UN specification for this indicator. This indicator has been identified in collaboration with topic experts.","national_data_update_url_text":"2018-12-17: see changes on

schools, colleges, universities and other formal educational institutions that normally constitutes a continuous \u2018ladder\u2019 of full-time education for children and young people, generally beginning at the age of 5 to 7 and continuing to up to 20 or 25 years old. In some countries, the upper parts of this \u2018ladder\u2019 are organized programmes of joint part-time employment and part-time participation in the regular school and university system. Non-formal education and training is defined as any organized and sustained learning activities that do not correspond exactly to the above definition of formal education. Non-formal education may therefore take place both within and outside educational institutions and cater to people of all ages. Depending on national contexts, it may cover educational programmes to impart adult literacy, life-skills, work-skills, and general culture.","reporting_status":"complete","data_non_statistical":false,"graph_type":"line","graph_title":"Percentage of youth (aged 16-24 years) in education, employment or training","data_show_map":false,"data_keywords":"Labour Force","source_active_1":true,"source_organisation_1":"Office for National Statistics (ONS)","source_periodicity_1":"Quarterly","source_earliest_available_1":2001,"source_geographical_coverage_1":"United Kingdom","source_url_1":"https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peoplenotinwork/unemployment/datasets/youngpeoplenotineducationemploymentortrainingneettable1","source_url_text_1":"Young people not in education, employment or training (NEET)","source_release_date_1":"23/08/2018","source_next_release_1":"22/11/2018","source_statistical_classification_1":"National Statistic","source_contact_1":"yanitsa.petkova@ons.gsi.gov.uk","source_other_info_1":"Seasonally standardised data used","source_active_2":false,"source_active_3":false,"source_active_4":false,"source_active_5":false,"source_active_6":false,"indicator_sort_order":"04-03-01","comments_limitations":">- >- The CSEW does not cover the population living in group residences (for example, care homes or student halls of residence) or other institutions This indicator is being used as an approximation of the UN SDG Indicator.
