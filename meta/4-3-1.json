In some countries, the upper parts of this \u2018ladder\u2019 are organized programmes of joint part-time employment and part-time participation in the regular school and university system. Non-formal education and training is defined as any organized and sustained learning activities that do not correspond exactly to the above definition of formal education. Non-formal education may therefore take place both within and outside educational institutions and cater to people of all ages. Depending on national contexts, it may cover educational programmes to impart adult literacy, life-skills, work-skills, and general culture.","reporting_status":"complete","data_non_statistical":false,"graph_type":"line","graph_title":"Percentage of youth (aged 16-24 years) in education, employment or training","data_show_map":false,"data_keywords":"Labour Force","source_active_1":true,"source_organisation_1":"Office for National Statistics (ONS)","source_periodicity_1":"Quarterly","source_earliest_available_1":2001,"source_geographical_coverage_1":"United Kingdom","source_url_1":"https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peoplenotinwork/unemployment/datasets/youngpeoplenotineducationemploymentortrainingneettable1","source_url_text_1":"Young people not in education, employment or training (NEET)","source_release_date_1":"23/08/2018","source_next_release_1":"22/11/2018","source_statistical_classification_1":"National Statistic","source_contact_1":"yanitsa.petkova@ons.gsi.gov.uk","source_other_info_1":"Seasonally standardised data used","source_active_2":false,"source_active_3":false,"source_active_4":false,"source_active_5":false,"source_active_6":false,"indicator_sort_order":"04-03-01","comments_limitations":">- >- The CSEW does not cover the population living in group residences (for example, care homes or student halls of residence) or other institutions This indicator is being used as an approximation of the UN SDG Indicator.
